                                <p>There's something profoundly intimate about writing a letter to yourself. The pen hesitates over paper – or fingers pause over keys – as you consider how to address the person you know best yet sometimes understand least: you.</p>
                     
                                <p>I recently discovered the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A7-dear-%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A8/dp/B0CSR63DVG" target="_blank"> "Dear Me; عزيزي أنا" </a> and found myself captivated by its premise. The concept of having an honest conversation with yourself across time opens doorways to reflection that other forms of introspection rarely achieve. It inspired me to embark on my own journey of self-correspondence.</p>
                            </section>

                                <h2>Looking Back to Look Forward</h2>
                     
                                <p>Futures thinking experts call it "retrospective futurism" – the practice of standing in an imagined future and looking backward to trace how you arrived there. This approach reveals not just where you might go, but how the path unfolds, what obstacles appear, and which decisions become pivotal.</p>
                     
                                <p>So today, I'm writing to myself at two different points: the me who arrived in Morocco in December 2020, wide-eyed and uncertain; and the future me who has moved beyond my current crossroads. Both perspectives reveal truths about the journey I'm on.</p>

Exhausted, anxious, phone clutched in your hand with that message from your wife – "We believe in you." You're wondering if leaving behind a stable job at Olam during a global pandemic was the most foolish decision you've ever made.</em></p>
                     
                                    <p><em>I wish you could see what I see now.</em></p>

                                    <p><em>That sweltering day in Ilorin when the acceptance email from UM6P arrived still feels vivid to me. Three years as a packaging supervisor had nearly crushed your spirit – the constant mechanical drone, the shouted instructions, the relentless pressure. Your Bachelor's in Crop and Environmental Protection seemed increasingly distant from your daily reality. That application for an MSc in Collective Intelligence felt like a moonshot.</em></p>

Those ecosystems you studied will serve as perfect metaphors for the human networks you're about to understand.</em></p>

You'll figure out everything together, from finding the cheapest groceries to deciphering university bureaucracy. Hold tight to those friendships; they're carrying more weight than you realize.</em></p>

                                    <p><em>The journey from Casablanca to Benguerir will introduce you to landscapes unlike anything in southwestern Nigeria. The UM6P campus will appear as a thoughtful blend of modern architecture with traditional Moroccan influences. Your room will offer views of mountains that will become familiar landmarks in your new life.</em></p>

French will become less a wall and more a door – perhaps not fully open, but no longer locked.</em></p>
                     
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p><em>Those video calls with your family will become both the highlight of your weeks and sometimes the hardest part of your day.

The detour to the southwestern region near Iseyin will feel like failure but provide crucial perspective.</em></p>

                                    <p><em>When you return to Morocco after the internship, the job search will test you severely. Rejection emails will accumulate. Your savings will dwindle. In your university-provided accommodation, you'll lie awake calculating how long you can keep trying before surrendering the dream.</em></p>

                                <p>Writing these letters has revealed something crucial: the threads connecting my past, present, and future form a pattern more coherent than I realized while living through each moment. The challenges that once seemed random – leaving Nigeria, navigating a new culture, language barriers, security concerns, employment uncertainty – now appear as necessary steps in a meaningful journey.</p>

                                <p>This practice of corresponding with yourself across time isn't merely therapeutic; it's revelatory. It helps identify the underlying narrative of your life – not the story as others might tell it, but as you experience it from within.</p>

                                <p>The book "Dear Me; عزيزي أنا" offers this gift: the recognition that we are simultaneously who we have been and who we are becoming. Our present stands at the intersection of memory and possibility.</p>

                                <p>I invite you to try this exercise yourself. Write to the person you were at a critical juncture. Write to the person you might become. Listen carefully to what emerges in this conversation with yourself across time. You might discover, as I did, that your journey makes more sense than you thought, and that your future holds more possibility than you imagined.</p>
                     
                                <br>
                                    
                                <p>The desert teaches us that landscapes transform gradually, then suddenly. Sand shifts imperceptibly until one day, the dunes have completely rearranged themselves. Perhaps our lives follow similar patterns – changes accumulating silently until we suddenly find ourselves transformed.</p>
                     
                                <br>
                                    
                                <p>Whatever storms you're weathering, whatever transitions you're navigating, remember: you too can rise above them like an eagle, gaining perspective that's impossible to see from within the turbulence. Your story continues unfolding, one letter to yourself at a time.</p>
