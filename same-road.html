                        <article>
                            <p>I was sitting in a noisy café in Lagos last year, watching a group of people at the next table. There was a street vendor, a guy with a guitar, and a tourist with a camera. They didn’t know each other, but somehow they ended up laughing together, the vendor showing off his beads, the guitarist strumming a little tune, and the tourist filming it all. By the end of the afternoon, they had a little crowd around them, and the vendor sold more beads in an hour than he usually did in a day. It hit me—sometimes the best things happen when people who are nothing alike come together and just… click.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately—how we all bring our own stories, our own shoes, to the table. I mean, think about the last time you worked on something with other people. Maybe it was a school project, a work thing, or even just planning a family party. Everyone’s got their own way of seeing things, right? I remember trying to organize a community event once, and I was so focused on schedules and logistics that I didn’t even think about how the space would feel. Then my friend, who’s a total artist at heart, suggested stringing up fairy lights and playing music. It changed everything—people stayed longer, talked more, and actually connected. I’d been so stuck in my head that I didn’t see what she saw. That’s what happens when you let different perspectives mix—they fill in the gaps you didn’t even know were there.</p>

                            <p>It’s not always easy, though. I’ve been in groups where everyone’s trying to talk over each other, and you can feel the tension. But even then, something magic can happen if you stick with it. I heard about this project where a bunch of coders from all over the world were working on some software—I think it was something like Linux. They didn’t meet in person, didn’t even speak the same first language half the time, but they kept adding to each other’s work. One person would fix a bug, another would add a feature, and over time, they built something that millions of people use every day. It wasn’t one genius in a basement; it was a whole bunch of people, each with their own quirks, chipping in.</p>

                            <figure class="wrapped-image right">
                                <img src="images/open-source.jpg" alt="Open Source Collaboration" class="blog-post-image">
                                <figcaption>Contributors to an open-source project, working remotely.</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>I guess what I’m getting at is that collaboration isn’t about being the same—it’s about being different and still finding a way to walk together. It’s like when you’re on a road trip with friends, and everyone’s got their own playlist. You might argue over the music, but by the end of the trip, you’ve got this shared vibe that’s better than any one song. That’s what collective intelligence feels like to me. It’s not a buzzword or some fancy concept—it’s just us, figuring things out together, one step at a time.</p>

                            <p>Next time you’re working with someone who sees the world differently, don’t shy away from it. Lean in. Let their ideas bump up against yours. You might just end up somewhere you never expected—somewhere better.</p>
