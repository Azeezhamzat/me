              <p>Africa's health systems remain fragile, burdened by deep-rooted weaknesses. Many hospitals and clinics still lack stable electricity, clean water, basic medical supplies, and enough trained staff. When crises hit, responses are sluggish and fragmented. People bear the brunt. Health systems fail under fractured structures, coordination is weak, and funding shortfalls leave hospitals in dire conditions.</p>

              <p>Some progress is visible. Countries like Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, and Senegal are increasing pharmaceutical production, yet local vaccine output meets just 1% of demand (Mohammed et al., 2023). Africa accounts for only 3% of global pharmaceutical manufacturing (Asoko Insight, 2023), with 80% of production concentrated in a handful of countries (Ussai et al., 2022), leaving much of the continent dependent on imports. While some healthcare networks are expanding, and hospitals are being built, rural areas remain underserved, and local production falls far short of need.</p>

              <h2>Persistent Gaps in Africa's Health Systems</h2>

              <h3>1. Weak Infrastructure and Funding Constraints</h3>
              <p>Many healthcare facilities struggle to function under poor conditions. Roughly half of primary healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to clean water and sanitation, making infection control difficult (AfDB, 2022). Electricity shortages are another major challenge, with at least 25,000 facilities operating with no power supply and 68,350 relying on unreliable electricity (Seforall, 2023).</p>

              <p>Financial limitations make these challenges worse. The $4.5 billion in capital expenditure from African governments each year is far below the estimated $26 billion needed annually to meet growing health demands. Hospitals remain underfunded, with shortages of staff, equipment, and essential medicines.</p>

              <h3>2. Dependence on Imported Medicines and Supply Chain Failures</h3>
              <p>Africa still relies heavily on foreign pharmaceutical products. Between 61% (WEF, 2023) to 90% of pharmaceuticals are imported, leaving many countries unable to secure essential medicines when global supply chains are disrupted. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these weaknesses as wealthier nations secured vaccine supplies while many African countries waited.</p>

              <p>While companies like Aspen Pharmacare in South Africa and Biopharma in Morocco are increasing local drug production, many factories still depend on imported raw materials (Narsai, & Abudu, 2024). Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) remain a major weakness. Without stronger API production capacity and coordinated supply chains, pharmaceutical self-sufficiency will remain out of our reach.</p>

              <h3>3. Workforce Shortages and Migration of Health Professionals</h3>
              <p>The continent is facing a critical shortage of trained healthcare workers. The WHO estimates that the continent needs 6.1 million more health workers to meet basic healthcare needs by 2030 (WHO, 2022, Ahmat et al., 2022). With only 300,000 doctors and 1.2 million nurses across the continent, the gap is widening.</p>

              <p>Many professionals, including doctors and nurses, migrate abroad in search of better pay and working conditions, leaving hospitals in their home countries struggling. Even well-equipped facilities cannot function effectively without enough trained personnel. Retaining health workers requires better pay structures, improved working conditions, and incentives for professionals to stay and serve their communities.</p>

              <h3>4. Weak Disease Surveillance and Response Systems</h3>
              <p>Detecting and containing outbreaks remains a challenge due to fragmented disease surveillance systems. Many African countries lack the infrastructure needed for real-time disease tracking, leading to delays in identifying public health threats. Factors such as weak data-sharing networks, insufficient diagnostic facilities, and underfunded epidemiology units contribute to the vulnerability of African nations to recurrent health crises (Ashenafi, Aytenew, et al., 2024).</p>

              <p>Strengthening real-time surveillance and community-led outbreak monitoring could allow faster responses, reducing the spread of infectious diseases before they escalate into full-scale health crises. Regional collaboration is also necessary to prevent the rapid spread of diseases across borders.</p>

              <h3>5. Poor Health Spending and External Aid Dependence</h3>
              <p>Funding problems in African healthcare are compounded by mismanagement, with health budgets often affected by inefficiency, corruption, and poor planning. The absence of performance-based health financing, where funds are allocated based on outcomes, further exacerbates these issues. Over-reliance on external aid also poses a risk. Cuts to funding, such as those to U.S. PEPFAR, can disrupt critical programs like HIV/AIDS treatment, highlighting the vulnerability of depending on donor contributions.</p>

              <p>Efforts to enhance vaccine independence face obstacles, such as the freeze on U.S. aid, which has stalled the USAID Malaria Vaccine Development Program and delayed crucial research. The inequitable distribution of mpox vaccines, with Africa being the hardest-hit region but left waiting, further underscores the need for local production capabilities. While the proposed African Epidemic Fund aims to improve financial resilience (CGDEV, 2024), it must be structured to ensure accountability and avoid political interference.</p>

              <h3>6. Malnutrition and Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)</h3>
              <p>Africa's healthcare systems have historically focused on infectious diseases; however, there is a concerning rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer (Kassa et al., 2024). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), NCDs accounted for 37% of deaths in Africa in 2019, up from 24% in 2000 (WHO, 2021). Unfortunately, many health policies have not adapted to this shift, leaving large populations without access to specialized care for chronic conditions.</p>

              <p>At the same time, malnutrition continues to be a significant issue, particularly among children. Africa has the highest prevalence of childhood stunting globally, a condition linked to long-term cognitive impairment and poor health outcomes (Seretew, Wullo Sisay, et al., 2024). This dual burden of malnutrition is exacerbated by urban populations experiencing an increase in obesity-related diseases due to changes in diet and lifestyle. The African region faces a unique challenge as it grapples with both undernutrition and rising obesity rates, driven by urbanization and sedentary lifestyles.</p>

              <p>Without adapting healthcare strategies to address these emerging challenges effectively, Africa's disease burden is projected to continue expanding. The Africa CDC warns that by 2030, NCDs and injuries may cause more premature deaths on the continent than all other conditions combined (Africa CDC, 2022).</p>

              <h2>What Needs to Change</h2>

              <p>Africa's health challenges are not new, yet the same weaknesses persist. Solutions exist, but implementation remains slow. African universities and research institutions cannot remain in the background, analyzing crises after they happen. They must be central to the work of building stronger disease surveillance, supporting pharmaceutical self-sufficiency, and ensuring that research drives policy.</p>

              <h3>1. Universities Must Lead in Health Foresight and Anticipation</h3>
              <p>Health crises do not appear without warning. Disease patterns are shaped by climate, migration, urbanization, and infrastructure. Yet, much of Africa's health research remains reactive. Universities should invest in early-warning models, community-based surveillance systems, and better disease tracking tools rather than waiting for crises to unfold. Health faculties should work with data scientists, climate researchers, and local health workers to develop real-time monitoring systems. Training programs should also prepare future public health leaders to anticipate threats and act before outbreaks escalate.</p>

              <h3>2. Health Research Must Move Beyond Academia</h3>
              <p>Many research findings remain within academic circles, disconnected from the spaces where decisions are made. Governments, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies rarely engage with university researchers, while many researchers focus on publication without translating their work into practical impact.</p>

              <p>African universities need stronger networks with decision-makers to ensure that research shapes policy, funding priorities, and industry practices. Medical schools and public health departments should focus on research that leads to real-world interventions rather than studies that remain in journals.</p>

              <h3>3. Strengthening the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain with Local Production</h3>
              <p>Africa remains dependent on external supply chains for medicine and vaccines. Universities should work directly with local pharmaceutical companies to address this vulnerability. Strengthening pharmaceutical production requires more than drug research. It involves developing expertise in manufacturing, improving infrastructure, and supporting regulatory changes that allow domestic production to expand.</p>

              <p>One of the biggest gaps is in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) production. Most African drug manufacturers still rely on imported ingredients. Universities should focus on R&D for local alternatives, testing new approaches and providing scientific backing for policies that support domestic manufacturing.</p>

              <p>Collaboration should also extend beyond national borders. Regional research hubs, where institutions across Africa work together on pharmaceutical innovation, could make local production more sustainable.</p>

              <h3>4. Fixing the Health Workforce Crisis at the Root</h3>
              <p>Africa's shortage of health workers is not only about migration. It is also about how professionals are trained and retained. Universities should rethink their approach to medical and public health education, ensuring that training aligns with actual health system needs rather than producing graduates who seek opportunities abroad.</p>

              <p>Medical and nursing schools should expand mid-level health worker training programs so that healthcare remains accessible in underfunded regions. Governments and institutions must also rethink incentives to retain skilled professionals. Scholarships, subsidized education, and training programs should be tied to service commitments in underserved areas.</p>

              <h3>5. Improving Health System Financing</h3>
              <p>Many health systems in Africa struggle due to poor planning, inefficient spending, and external dependency. Universities should take a more active role in health finance research, tracking where money goes and designing better models for funding healthcare sustainably.</p>

              <p>Public-private partnerships should be more than a way to secure funding. They should ensure that investments lead to meaningful improvements in healthcare delivery. This requires greater transparency in health budgets, better performance-based funding mechanisms, and financial models that reduce reliance on external donors.</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>

              <p>Africa's health systems will not be transformed by external interventions or short-term aid. The real work lies within. The institutions that train the next generation of doctors, nurses, and policymakers cannot remain detached from the systems they are meant to strengthen. Our universities must recognize that they are not only places of learning but also engines of change.</p>

              <p>They shape the people who will decide health policies, develop medicines, and build the research foundations that guide public health strategies. If they remain passive, those who lack the necessary expertise / vision will continue making decisions that affect millions.</p>
